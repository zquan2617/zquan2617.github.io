Hi! I am Quan Zou. I am an MPhil student studying Cognitive Neuroscience at [MRC CBU](https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/). Previously, I graduated from the University of Michigan, where I studied Biopsychology, Cognition, and Neurosicence (BCN), Cognitive Science (in Computation) and Linguistics with a minor in Computer Science.
